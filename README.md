Small file cleaner
Movie File Cleaner: This was a project I came up with to brush up on my python skills. It is a simple script that scans the user's movie folder and deletes any files that are under a certain file size to get rid of sample videos and uploader advertisement videos, as well as file types that the user doesnt want such as uploader advertisements in text files or pictures. The program uses a TK GUI for the user to select the directory, view the ammount of files scanned, bad files found, and space to be cleared, and finally confirm that they would like to delete. I am currently adding a feature that will also clean up directory and file names so they follow a "movie-title.year-produced.extension" format. I look forward to completing this project over time.
